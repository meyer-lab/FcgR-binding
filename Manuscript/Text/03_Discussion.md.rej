-A unified model accounting for IC avidity and affinity provides a framework for reasoning about the effects of changing antibody-antigen binding or constant region composition ([@Fig:Fit]). Glycosylation forms and engineered mutants, in addition to variation in antigen binding, exponentially expand the repertoire of antibody variants possible. The quantitative model presented here provides a robust framework for reasoning about the contributions of each of these variables. Since it would not be feasible to experimentally explore all combinations of these variables, such a model is necessary for knowing which combinations would result in the most effective immunotherapeutic intervention. Further, a unified model for IC engagement may make it possible to consider the effects of antibody combinations in a rational manner.

-In addition to enabling rationally designed immunotherapeutic interventions, our model of IC engagement makes it feasible to infer the factors contributing to the *in vivo* efficacy of existing immunotherapies ([@Fig:InVivoResults]). In particular, we show through the application of our model to murine immunotherapy data that such a model can predict the effect of tumor-targeted antibodies better than affinity in isolation. This model additionally provides a number of specific, testable predictions: First, mIgG2a and mIgG2b operate through distinct cell populations, and this explains the differing capacity of the A/I ratio to predict their efficacy ([@Fig:InVivoResults]H). Caution is necessary when interpreting the prediction that efficacy is derived primarily through eosinophil engagement—our model distinguishes cell populations only by their receptor expression, and endogenous IgG could shift the abundance of receptor available for interaction. In particular, classical monocytes have a very similar pattern of receptor expression as eosinophils ([@fig:SuppTwo]A). Second, even modest reductions in inhibitory FcγR engagement may drastically increase the efficacy of mIgG2b so long that activating receptor affinities are preserved ([@Fig:InVivoResults]I).
+In addition to enabling rationally designed immunotherapeutic interventions, our model of IC engagement makes it feasible to infer the factors contributing to the *in vivo* efficacy of existing immunotherapies ([@Fig:InVivoResults]). In particular, we show through the application of our model to murine immunotherapy data that such a model can predict the effect of tumor-targeted antibodies better than affinity alone. From this application, our model provides a few specific, testable predictions concerning murine immune effector function. First, mIgG2a and mIgG2b operate through distinct cell populations: mIgG2a through eisonophils and mIgG2b through neutrophils and non-canonical monocytes. This accounts the differing capacity of the A/I ratio to predict their efficacy ([@Fig:InVivoResults]H). Caution is necessary when interpreting the prediction that efficacy is derived primarily through eosinophil engagement. Our model distinguishes cell populations only by their receptor expression. Endogenous IgG could shift the abundance of receptor available for interaction *in vivo*, something our model does not innately account for. Additionally, classical monocytes have a very similar pattern of receptor expression as eosinophils, so it is unexpected that our PCA analysis does not predict that the contributions of these two populations to effector function would be comparable ([@fig:SuppTwo]A). Second, even modest reductions in inhibitory FcγR engagement may drastically increase the efficacy of mIgG2b so long that activating receptor affinities are preserved ([@Fig:InVivoResults]I).
