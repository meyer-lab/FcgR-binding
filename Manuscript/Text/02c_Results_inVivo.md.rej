 To study *in vivo* effector response, we focused on the manipulations made in one study wherein antibodies against the B16F10 melanoma antigen TRP1 (TA99) were applied to block lung metastasis in C57BL/6 mice [@Nimmerjahn:2005hu]. Using a panel of antibodies with differing constant region but identical antigen binding revealed that an A/I ratio predicted response as observed previously ([@Fig:InVivoResults]B). However, we noted that murine IgG2b (mIgG2b) showed divergence from the strong relationship observed with the other antibody constructs. To study this panel of interventions further, we included a number of murine FcγR (mFcγR) knockout or blocking manipulations by assuming the affinity of the receptor would be zero (SUPP TABLE). The A/I ratio cannot exist in the absence of an inhibitory receptor, and so we regressed the log-transformed maximal activating affinity and inhibitory receptor affinity, including knockout receptor conditions, to see whether this information could predict response in the broader panel ([@Fig:InVivoResults]C). The highest affinity activating receptor $K_a$ and inhibitory receptor $K_a$, even when treated as separate quantities, poorly predicted response in this larger panel, suggesting that other information is required to predict response within a wider panel of perturbations.
 
-Examining the affinities present with each intervention emphasized that each antibody treatment differs in a multivariate way ([@Fig:InVivoResults]D); a single principal component explained only 62% of the variation in affinities across each condition. We hypothesized that, although the A/I ratio captures the dominant variation for smaller changes in antibody binding, this other variation becomes important for more divergent interventions. Using mFcγR measurements for a panel of peripheral immune populations ([@fig:SuppTwo]A), we applied our binding model to predict the activity index for each population and intervention, assuming a set avidity and ligand concentration ([@Fig:InVivoResults]E). Regressing the activity index of each cell population against response showed a superior predictive capacity even within the wider panel of interventions ([@Fig:InVivoResults]F). Choice of avidity and ligand concentration did not affect the results but multiple cell populations, including eosiniphils and classical monocytes, were required for predicting response ([@Fig:InVivoResults]G, [@fig:SuppTwo]B).
