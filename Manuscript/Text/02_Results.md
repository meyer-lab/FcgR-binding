Building upon earlier work in which immune complex avidity was shown to alter human FcγR-IgG binding, we wished to examine the influence of immune complex avidity and composition on binding and activation of different human FcγRs (hFcγRs) [@Lux:2013iv]. We assessed the binding of immune complex presenting one of four IgG subclasses to cells expressing one of six hFcgR subclasses at a single immune complex concentration. To do so, we utilized a panel of CHO cell lines, each stably expressing a single hFcgR species, and two populations of immune complex, with averaged avidities of 4 and 26, assembled by covalently attaching 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) to BSA. Anti-TNP antibodies of differing IgG class were bound to the BSA complexes before treatment. The measured binding and variation in binding with avidity recapitulated that measured before, with variation as a function of IgG class, hFcγR, and avidity [@Lux:2013iv]  ([@Fig:Binding]A).

We quantitatively measured receptor abundance for each hFcγR-expressing cell line to account for this source of potential variation in binding. This revealed 20-fold variation in the amount of each hFcγR expressed ([@Fig:Binding]B). To interpret these measurements, we normalized the amount of binding measured to the amount of hFcγR expressed and plotted each measurement against the measured affinity of the individual hFcγR-IgG monovalent interaction. We observed a strong correlation between the affinity of the relevant hFcγR-IgG pair and measured binding, along with a shift toward more binding with increased avidity ([@Fig:Binding]C-D). By comparing each TNP-26-BSA and TNP-4-BSA measurement, we observed that the avidity-dependent change in binding varied with the relevant affinity of the hFcγR-IgG monovalent interaction ([@Fig:Binding]E), with lower affinity interactions more avidity-dependent. These observations indicated to us that affinity, avidity, and receptor expression were all critical to interpreting immune complex binding.

To interpret the complex variation in binding we observed with each hFcγR-IgG pair (i.e. affinity), receptor expression, and immune complex avidity, we employed an equilibrium model of multivalent ligand/monovalent receptor binding [@Stone:2001fm]. Within the model, an initial binding event occurs with the kinetics of the monovalent interaction ([@Fig:Fit]A). Subsequent multivalent binding events occur with a partition coefficient $K_x$. Values of $K_x$ much greater than 1 signify highly multivalent interactions, while $K_x$ values much less than 1 signify predominantly monovalent binding.

While previous applications of this model have assumed $K_x$ to be constant, these have not dealt with the large variation in the affinity of the receptor-ligand interaction on ICs _in vivo_. [@Stone:2001fm; @Hlavacek:1999bb]. Treating this parameter as constant for interactions of similar affinity may be reasonable, but clearly breaks down when a wide range of receptor-ligand affinities is involved. For example, for an FcγR-IgG interaction of barely measurable affinity, one would not expect to see multimeric binding to occur with the same partitioning as an extremely high affinity interaction. Most concerning, given the assumption of equilibrium, is that an assumption of constant $K_x$ violates detailed balance when this model is extended to include expression of multiple FcγRs. Therefore, in attempt to resolve this issues, we assume that $K_x$ is proportional to $K_a$, such that there exists a crosslinking coefficient $K_x^{*}$ such that $K_x = K_x^{*}K_{a}$. With this assumption, detailed balance is preserved (see methods), and $K_x$ is reduced when $K_a$ is very low, as expected.

We utilized a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation to fit this model to our measurements of hFcγR-IgG binding [@ForemanMackey:2013ux]. We observed close agreement between measured values our model's prediction of each condition. ([@Fig:Fit]B). Both the sample autocorrelation ([@fig:Autocorrel]) and the Geweke diagnostic ([@Fig:Fit]C) indicate sampling convergence. Inspecting the fit of each parameter reveals that all parameters were well-specified, and that many of the parameter fits closely agree with prior expectations. The $K_x^*$ parameter was found to be roughly $10^{-12}$ ([@Fig:Fit]D). For the high-affinity hFcγRIA-IgG1 interaction, this comes out to a cross-linking constant of $6\times 10^{-5}$ per cell^-1^, close to the crosslinking constant of $1.35\times 10^{-5}$ per cell^-1^ observed for the high affinity IgE-FcεR interaction [@Hlavacek:1999bb]. This fit for the crosslinking coefficient falls within a range that provides differing binding behaviour dependent upon the affinity of the receptor interaction ([@Fig:Fit]E). Namely, the predicted binding valency upon a single IC interaction responds to changes in both affinity and receptor expression level. Finally, there was a 1.6-fold difference in the fit values of the conversion coefficients and which convert the number of TNP-4-BSA and TNP-26-BSA bound to mean fluroescent intensity, with the coefficient for TNP-26-BSA being larger ([@Fig:Fit]F). A difference in the IC-to-fluorescence conversion coefficients is expected as IC binding was measured with an anti-TNP fluorescent antibody.

Our prior distribution constrained the TNP-4 and TNP-26 avidities between one and eight and between twenty and thirty-two respectively, which must be considered when interpreting the resulting fit ([@Fig:Fit]G). Within this constraint, there was a strong preference toward higher effective avidity with both species. The deviation parameter for the IC binding data fit to a greater value than the standard error of the receptor expression measurements, consistent with greater variation in the avidity parameters ([@Fig:Fit]H). We compared the receptor expression deviation parameter to its experimental value by calculating the standard error of the experimental values normalized to the mean of each measurement, then averaging these values. The resultant number (0.08) was close to and fell within one standard deviation of the predicted value (0.06). Finally, fits of receptor expression closely matched measured levels ([@Fig:Fit]I). In total, this demonstrates that a multivalent binding model accurately captures hFcγR-IgG binding.

## A binding model provides specific predictions for the coordinate effects of immune complex abundance, avidity, and IgG class

With confidence that an equilibrium binding model can predict FcγR-immune complex binding, we sought to apply the model to make predictions about the combined influence of avidity and affinity on effector function. We focused on hFcγRIIIA, which is expressed alone within NK cells, or alongside hFcγRIIB in dendritic and other cell populations. Predicted binding curves showed a shift left with increasing avidity, consistent with the effects observed in similar contexts [@Ortiz:2016kc]  ([@Fig:pModel]A). Examining the number of receptor-receptor crosslinks or the abundance of receptors in multimer complexes instead showed a stronger response to avidity, and biphasic concentration dependence ([@Fig:pModel]B-C). As a consequence of the difference on receptor multimerization or binding, avidity leads to far more oligomerization with much less receptor binding ([@Fig:pModel]B-D). For example, an immune complex of avidity thirty-two leads to the same amount of receptor oligomerization as the peak for avidity two at a 1000-fold lower concentration, and while binding roughly 50-fold less receptor. This emphasizes that avidity is an essential factor to consider for enacting effector responses, and measuring receptor binding alone cannot predict the consequent FcγR oligomerization.

In contrast to NK cells, other innate immune cell types express activating and inhibitory hFcγRs in combination. Specifically, the inhibitory receptor hFcγRIIB is known to dampen effector function both endogenously and during a response to exogenous IgG treatment [@RavetchRev]. We wondered how coordinate expression of an activating and inhibiting receptor would modulate the hFcγR-IC complexes formed. We first plotted the abundance of multimerized hFcγRIIIA versus hFcγRIIB for varied avidity and concentration of immune complexes. This indicated that, at low concentrations, hFcγRIIIA multimerization dominated at all avidities ([@Fig:pModel]F). Past a threshold concentration, hFcγRIIIA multimerization plateaued, and hFcγRIIB multimerization accumulated. This effect was very similar for different avidities, and only varied in magnitude, indicating that the effect of the lower affinity inhibitory receptor may modulate the concentration dependence of response more so than the relationship with avidity. We additionally explored the influence of hFcγRIIB by defining an "activity index" (see methods) as a surrogate measure for effector response. This predicted that inhibitory receptor has little effect on the dose response relationship with respect to concentration or avidity ([@Fig:pModel]C&G).

Instead, we wondered if an inhibitory receptor plays a larger role on influencing the relative response between IgG classes as compared to avidity/IC concentration. Indeed, earlier work examining interventions of antibodies with constant variable regions but of differing IgG class identified that the ratio of the highest affinity activating receptor $K_a$ to that of the inhibitory receptor could predict the influence of each intervention. While this ratio has proven successful across many contexts, we wondered if our model might identify the molecular reason for this quantity [@Nimmerjahn:2005hu; @Mimoto:2013gf; @Bournazos:2014cw]. By varying the affinity of the activating receptor, we indeed observed a strong log-log relationship between the "A/I" ratio and activity index over the range of ratios previously examined ([@Fig:pModel]H). A second implicit assumption of the "A/I" ratio is that the highest affinity receptor dominates response. By varying the affinity of each receptor in a four receptor model, we indeed observed that the highest affinity receptor had a greater influence on response than ay other receptor ([@Fig:pModel]I). Indeed, as the lower affinity receptors were shifted to have higher affinity than the original, there was a shift toward dependence on that receptor.
