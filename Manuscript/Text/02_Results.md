## IgG-FcγR binding varies with affinity and avidity

![**FcγR binding changes with FcγR-IgG pair and avidity.** A) Quantification of human IgG subclass TNP-4-BSA and TNP-26-BSA immune complex binding to CHO cells expressing the indicated human FcγRs (N = 4). Background binding of the immune complexes to CHO cells expressing no human FcγR was subtracted from the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) obtained for binding to CHO cells expressing individual human FcγRs. B) Receptor expression quantification for each CHO cell line expressing individual FcγRs. C) Measured TNP-4-BSA immune complex binding, normalized to the receptor expression within each CHO cell line, as a function of the measured FcγR-IgG subclass affinity [@Bruhns:2009kg]. D) Measured TNP-26-BSA immune complex binding, normalized to the receptor expression within each CHO cell line, as a function of the measured FcγR-IgG subclass affinity [@Bruhns:2009kg].](./Figures/Figure1.png){#fig:Binding}

Building upon earlier work, we wished to examine the influence of immune complex avidity and composition on binding and subsequent activation of different FcγRs [@Lux:2013iv]. In a similar manner to before, we assessed the immune complex binding for each pair of four IgG and six FcγR subclasses at a single concentration. To do so, we utilized a panel of CHO cell lines stably expressing each FcgR and immune complexes assembled by use of BSA with 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) covalently attached at an average avidity of 4 or 26. anti-TNP antibodies of differing IgG class were then bound to the BSA complexes prior to treatment.

In order to verify its contribution to variation in measured binding, receptor abundance was measured quantitatively for each FcgR expressing cell line. This measurement revealed 20-fold variation in the amount of each FcγR expressed ([@Fig:Binding]A). Therefore, to interpret these measurements, we normalized the amount of binding measured to the amount of FcγR expressed, and plotted each measurement with respect to the measured affinity of the individual FcγR-IgG monovalent interaction ([@Fig:Binding]B). The measured binding and variation in binding with avidity closely recapitulated that measured previously [@Lux:2013iv].

By comparing the normalized binding to the affinity of each FcgR-IgG interaction,










## A multivalent binding model accounts for variation in IgG-FcγR binding

![**A multivalent binding model accounts for IgG-FcγR binding.** A) Schematic of the multivalent binding model for interaction of an immune complex with FcγRs. B) Trace for MCMC chain during fitting process. C) Predicted versus measured binding for each FcγR-IgG pair at each avidity. D) Marginal distribution for the crosslinking constant Kx. E) Marginal distribution for the constants to convert immune complex binding to normalized fluorescence signal. Note that each TNP-BSA experiment was normalized to the average signal across the experiment, and so TNP-26-BSA need not necessarily have 26/4-fold greater signal than TNP-4-BSA. F) Marginal distribution for the avidity of TNP-4-BSA and TNP-26-BSA. G) Marginal distribution for each distribution spread parameter. H) The marginal distributions for receptor expression within each cell line expressing a signal FcγR. Experimental measurements of receptor expression are individually overlaid.
