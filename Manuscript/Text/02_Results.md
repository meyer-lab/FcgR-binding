## IgG-FcγR binding varies with affinity and avidity

![**FcγR binding changes with FcγR-IgG pair and avidity.** A) Receptor expression quantification for each CHO cell line expressing individual FcγRs. B) Quantification of human IgG subclass TNP-4-BSA and TNP-26-BSA immune complex binding to CHO cells expressing the indicated human FcγRs (N = 4).

Building upon earlier work, in which immune complex avidity altered FcγR-IgG binding, we wished to examine the influence of immune complex avidity and composition on binding and activation of different FcγRs [@Lux:2013iv]. In a similar manner to before, we assessed the immune complex binding for each pair of four IgG and six FcγR subclasses at a single concentration. To do so, we utilized a panel of CHO cell lines stably expressing each FcγR and immune complexes assembled by use of BSA with 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) covalently attached at an average avidity of 4 or 26. anti-TNP antibodies of differing IgG class were then bound to the BSA complexes before treatment. The measured binding and variation in binding with avidity recapitulated that measured before, with variation as a function of IgG class, FcγR, and avidity [@Lux:2013iv]  ([@Fig:Binding]A).

We quantitatively measured receptor abundance for each FcγR-expressing cell line to account for this source of potential variation in binding. This revealed 20-fold variation in the amount of each FcγR expressed ([@Fig:Binding]B). To interpret these measurements, we normalized the amount of binding measured to the amount of FcγR expressed and plotted each measurement against the measured affinity of the individual FcγR-IgG monovalent interaction. We observed a strong correlation between the affinity of the relevant FcγR-IgG pair and measured binding, along with a shift toward more binding with increased avidity ([@Fig:Binding]C-D). By comparing each TNP-26-BSA and TNP-4-BSA measurement, we observed that the avidity-dependent change in binding varied with the relevant affinity of the FcγR-IgG monovalent interaction ([@Fig:Binding]E), with lower affinity interactions more avidity-dependent. These observations indicated to us that affinity, avidity, and receptor expression were all critical to interpreting immune complex binding.

To interpret the complex variation in binding we observed with each IgG-FcγR pair (i.e. affinity), receptor expression, and immune complex avidity, we employed an equilibrium model of multivalent ligand/monovalent receptor binding [@Stone:2001fm]. Within the model, an initial binding event occurs with the kinetics of the monovalent interaction ([@Fig:Fit]A). Subsequent multivalent binding events occur with a partition coefficient K~x~. Thus, K~x~ values much greater than 1 lead to highly multivalent interactions while K~x~ values much less than 1 lead to predominantly monovalent binding.

While previous applications of this model have assumed K~x~ to be constant, those have not dealt with large variation in the affinity of the receptor-ligand interaction [@Stone:2001fm] [@Hlavacek:1999bb]. Treating this parameter as constant for interactions of similar affinity may be reasonable, but clearly breaks down at the extremes. For example, for an FcγR-IgG interaction of barely measurable affinity, one would not expect to see multimer binding to occur with the same partitioning as an extremely high affinity interaction. Most concerning given the assumption of equilibrium, an assumption of constant K~x~ violates detailed balance when this model is extended to include expression of multiple FcγRs. Therefore, to solve these issues, we assumed that K~x~ is proportional to K~a~. With this assumption, detailed balance is preserved (see methods), and K~x~ is reduced at the limit of low K~a~ as expected.

We utilized Markov Chain Monte Carlo to fit this model to our measurements of FcγR-IgG binding [@ForemanMackey:2013ux]. Comparing the prediction of each condition to our measured values, we observed extremely close agreement ([@Fig:Fit]B). Both inspection of the sample autocorrelation (TODO: ADD) and Geweke diagnostic indicated sampling convergence ([@Fig:Fit]C).  Inspecting the fit of each parameter revealed that all parameters were well-specified, and that many of the parameter fits closely agreed with prior expectations. The K~x~ parameter was found to be roughly $10^{-12}$ ([@Fig:Fit]D). For the high-affinity IgG1-FcγRI interaction, this comes out to a cross-linking constant of $6\times 10^{-5}$ per cell^-1^, close to the crosslinking constant of $1.35\times 10^{-5}$ per cell^-1^ observed for the high affinity IgE-FcεR interaction [@Hlavacek:1999bb]. The fit values of each conversion coefficient indicated a 1.6-fold difference in the relationship between the number of immune complexes bound and output fluorescence signal ([@Fig:Fit]E). A difference in the IC to fluorescence conversion is consistent with IC binding having been measured through TNP detection.

Our prior constrained the TNP-4 and TNP-26 avidity to within 1–8 and 20–32 respectively, which must be considered when interpreting the resulting fit ([@Fig:Fit]F). Within this constraint, there was a strong preference toward higher effective avidity with both species. The deviation parameter for the immune complex binding data fit to a greater value than the receptor expression measurements, consistent with greater variation in the former ([@Fig:Fit]G). We compared the receptor expression deviation parameter to its experimentally determined value by calculating the standard error normalized to the mean of each measurement, then averaging these values. The resultant number (0.08) was close to and fell within one standard deviation of the predicted value (0.06). In total, this demonstrates that a multivalent binding model accurately captures IgG-FcγR binding.

## A binding model provides specific predictions for the coordinate effects of immune complex abundance, avidity, and IgG class

With confidence that an equilibrium binding model can predict FcγR-immune complex binding, we sought to apply the model to make predictions about the combined influence of avidity and affinity on effector function. We focused on FcγRIIIA, which is expressed alone within NK cells, or alongside FcγRIIB in dendritic and other cell populations. Predicted binding curves showed a shift left with increasing avidity, consistent with the effects observed in similar contexts [@Ortiz:2016kc]  ([@Fig:pModel]A). Examining the number of receptor-receptor crosslinks or the abundance of receptors in multimer complexes instead showed a stronger response to avidity, and biphasic concentration dependence ([@Fig:pModel]B-C). As a consequence of the difference on receptor multimerization or binding, avidity leads to far more oligomerization with much less receptor binding ([@Fig:pModel]B-D). For example, an immune complex of avidity thirty-two leads to the same amount of receptor oligomerization as the peak for avidity two at a 1000-fold lower concentration, and while binding roughly 50-fold less receptor. This emphasizes that avidity is an essential factor to consider for enacting effector responses, and measuring receptor binding alone cannot predict the consequent FcγR oligomerization.

In contrast to NK cells, other innate immune cell types express activating and inhibitory FcγRs in combination. Specifically, the inhibitory receptor FcγRIIB is known to dampen effector function both endogenously and during a response to exogenous IgG treatment [@RavetchRev]. We wondered how coordinate expression of an activating and inhibiting receptor would modulate the FcγR-IC complexes formed. We first plotted the abundance of multimerized FcγRIIIA versus FcγRIIB for varied avidity and concentration of immune complexes. This indicated that, at low concentrations, FcγRIIIA multimerization dominated at all avidities ([@Fig:pModel]E). Past a threshold concentration, FcγRIIIA multimerization plateaued, and FcγRIIB multimerization accumulated. This effect was very similar for different avidities, and only varied in magnitude, indicating that the effect of the lower affinity inhibitory receptor may modulate the concentration dependence of response more so than the relationship with avidity. We additionally explored the influence of FcγRIIB by defining an "activity index" (see methods) as a surrogate measure for effector response. This predicted that inhibitory receptor has little effect on the dose response relationship with respect to concentration or avidity ([@Fig:pModel]C&F).

Instead, we wondered if an inhibitory receptor plays a larger role on influencing the relative response between IgG classes as compared to avidity/IC concentration. Indeed, earlier work examining interventions of antibodies with constant variable regions but of differing IgG class identified that the ratio of the highest affinity activating receptor Ka to that of the inhibitory receptor could predict the influence of each intervention. While this ratio has proven successful across many contexts, we wondered if our model might identify the molecular reasoning of this quantity [@Nimmerjahn:2005hu] [@Mimoto:2013gf] [@Bournazos:2014cw]. By varying the affinity of the activating receptor, we indeed observed a strong log-log relationship between the "A/I" ratio and activity index over the range of ratios previously examined ([@Fig:pModel]G). A second implicit assumption of the "A/I" ratio is that the highest affinity receptor dominates response. By varying the affinity of each receptor in a four receptor model, we indeed observed that the highest affinity receptor dominated response ([@Fig:pModel]H). Indeed, as the lower affinity receptors were shifted to be higher affinity than the original, there was a shift toward dependence on that receptor.
