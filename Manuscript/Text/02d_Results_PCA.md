## Comparing human and mouse IgG-FcγR interactions

![**Comparing human and mouse IgG-FcγR interactions.** A) Principal components analysis of predicted binding with coordinate changes in murine IgG class, immune complex avidity, and concentration. B) Corresponding principle components analysis for the human case.](./Figures/Figure5.svg){#fig:SpeciesCompare}

As a multivalent binding model can predict FcγR binding and effector function *in vivo*, we examined the multivariate effects on activation predicted with receptors from each species, to evaluate the conserved aspects.
