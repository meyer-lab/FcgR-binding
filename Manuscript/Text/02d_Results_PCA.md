![**Comparing human and mouse IgG-FcγR interactions.** A) Principal components analysis of predicted 1 nM IC binding and activation at with coordinate changes in murine IgG class and immune complex avidity.

As a multivalent binding model can predict FcγR binding and effector function *in vivo*, we examined the multivariate effects on activation predicted with receptors from each species. We expected that the activation model might help identify conserved aspects of FcγR signaling between species.

By assembling predictions for ligand binding and activity indices for murine NK and DC-like cell populations, we observed divergent effects dependent upon IC class. For both species, principal component 1 corresponded to overall binding or response of any sort (Fig. SXXXX). Beyond this variation, PC 2 separated DC-like and NK population binding and response, while PC 3 separated ligand binding from activity ([@Fig:SpeciesCompare]A). PC 2 separated IgG2b (more NK-biased) from IgG2a (more DC-like focused) while lower avidity conditions and IgG classes were intermediate in scores. This is consistent with these IgG classes showing divergent effects *in vivo*, and our predicted effects of the classes on NK and DC-like cells ([@Fig:InVivoResults]E).

Comparing these results to those with the human FcγR-IgG pairs revealed conserved parallels ([@Fig:SpeciesCompare]B). PC 2 loadings separated cell populations, while PC 3 separated ligand binding from activity.
