![**An FcγR-IgG binding model deconvolves *in vivo* function.** A) Schematic of earlier IgG subclass experiments (top) and our approach (bottom).

We wished to explore whether a multivalent binding model can enable one to reverse engineer effector function *in vivo*. We posited that our modeling approach would allow one to predict the effect of therapeutic interventions involving ICs with defined IgG subclass composition on driving responses of different cell populations based on their FcγR expression profile. Prior studies investigating treatments for HIV, cancer, and autoimmune dysfunction have utilized antibodies with constant antigen binding, while varying other parameters of FcγR engagement, to elucidate the effect of effector function [@Nimmerjahn:2005hu; @Bournazos:2014cw]. One finding from these studies is that the relative affinity of an IgG subclass to each FcγR is important to the resulting response. We hypothesized that a more exact model of FcγR engagement would more robustly predict effector response ([@Fig:InVivoResults]A).

To study *in vivo* effector response, we focused on the manipulations made in one study wherein antibodies against the B16F10 melanoma antigen TRP1 (TA99) were applied to block lung metastasis in C57BL/6 mice [@Nimmerjahn:2005hu]. Using a panel of antibodies with differing constant region but identical antigen binding revealed that an A/I ratio predicted response as observed previously ([@Fig:InVivoResults]B). However, we noted that murine IgG2b (mIgG2b) showed divergence from the strong relationship observed with the other antibody constructs. To study this panel of interventions further, we included a number of murine FcγR (mFcγR) knockout or blocking manipulations by assuming the affinity of the receptor would be zero (SUPP TABLE). The A/I ratio cannot exist in the absence of an inhibitory receptor, and so we regressed the log-transformed maximal activating affinity and inhibitory receptor affinity, including knockout receptor conditions, to see whether this information could predict response in the broader panel ([@Fig:InVivoResults]C). The highest affinity activating receptor $K_a$ and inhibitory receptor $K_a$, even when treated as separate quantities, poorly predicted response in this larger panel, suggesting that other information is required to predict response within a wider panel of perturbations.

Examining the affinities present with each intervention emphasized that each antibody treatment differs in a multivariate way ([@Fig:InVivoResults]D); a single principal component explained only 62% of the variation in affinities across each condition. We hypothesized that, although the A/I ratio captures the dominant variation for smaller changes in antibody binding, this other variation becomes important for more divergent interventions. Using mFcγR measurements for a panel of peripheral immune populations ([@fig:SuppTwo]A), we applied our binding model to predict the activity index for each population and intervention, assuming a set avidity and ligand concentration ([@Fig:InVivoResults]E). Regressing both quantities against response showed a superior predictive capacity even within the wider panel of interventions ([@Fig:InVivoResults]F). Choice of avidity and ligand concentration did not affect the results but eosinophils were required for predicting response ([@Fig:InVivoResults]G, [@fig:SuppTwo]B).

Examining the components of the resulting predictive model revealed how the A/I ratio is usually but not always predictive. Each input quantity was scaled by model weighting to indicate the relative contribution of each cell population ([@Fig:InVivoResults]E). From this, the divergent response of mIgG2b was elucidated. IgG2a and interventions well-explained by the A/I ratio are predicted to operate primarily through eosinophil activity by our model ([@Fig:InVivoResults]H). In contrast, IgG2b and IgG2b-fucose are predicted to operate primarily through neutrophils and non-classical monocytes. Finally, our model provides predictions for the efficacy of interventions, such as IgG2b, with specific changes in mFcγR affinity ([@Fig:InVivoResults]I).
