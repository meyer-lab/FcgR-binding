Model-driven design is vital for more effective manipulation of immune system operation. The complexity of immune system operation defies intuition for rationally selecting manipulations.


### A unified model for FcgR engagement will enable further refinement for the function of these receptors
  - Examining interaction of multiple antibodies
  - More precisely engineered glycosylation variants of Fc region
  - Improved systems view of effector function
