#### Future directions in FcgR engineering

A unified model for FcgR engagement will enable further refinement for the function of these receptors.





  - Examining interaction of multiple antibodies
  - More precisely engineered glycosylation variants of Fc region
  - Improved systems view of effector function



#### Immune engineering most generally

More generally, these results demonstrate the potential of molecular models linked to data-driven inferrence to deconvolve *in vivo* function. Model-driven design is vital for more effective manipulation of immune system operation---the complexity of immune system operation defies intuition. Like Fc receptors, many innate immune receptors are extensively characterized in their interactions and knockout effects, and yet likely operate through combinatorial complexity introduced by sets of protein species. With this "parts list" of immune system components, model-driven design with be an essential component of immune engineering.
