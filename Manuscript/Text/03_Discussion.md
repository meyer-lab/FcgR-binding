# Discussion

A unified model for the coordinate contributions of IC avidity and affinity provides a framework for reasoning about the effects of changing antibody-antigen binding or constant region composition ([@Fig:Fit]). Glycosylation forms and engineered mutants, in addition to variation in antigen binding, exponentially expand the repertoire of antibody variants possible. The quantitative models presented here provide a robust framework for reasoning about the contributions each of these variables. Since it would not be feasible to experimentally explore all combinations of these variables, such models are necessary for knowing which combinations would result in the most effective immunotherapeutic intervention. Further, a unified model for IC engagement may make it possible to consider the effects of antibody combinations in a rational manner.

In addition to enabling the intelligent design of immunotherapeutic interventions, our model of IC engagement and the activity index makes it feasible to infer factors contributing to the *in vivo* efficacy of existing immunotherapies ([@Fig:InVivoResults]). In particular, we show through through the application of our models to murine immunotherapy data that these models can predict the effect of tumor-targeted antibodies better than models that predict effector function using only receptor affinities. These models additionally provide a number of specific, testable predictions. First, mIgG2a chiefly operates through eosinophil activity, while mIgG2b operates primarily through neutrophils and noncanonical monocytes. This would account for the inability of the A/I ratio to predict both their efficacies ([@Fig:InVivoResults]H). We present the claim that mIgG2a effect works chiefly through eosinophil activation with caution. Our model predicts the relative contributions of cell populations to mIgG effector function based on their receptor expression levels; because classical monocytes and eosinophils have very similar expression levels, they are not confidently distinguishable ([@fig:SuppTwo]B). Our model predictions do not account for effects of endogenous mIgG on the abundance of receptor available for interaction. Second, we predict even modest reductions in inhibitory FcÎ³R engagement may drastically increase the efficacy of mIgG2b so long that activating receptor affinities are preserved ([@Fig:InVivoResults]I).

Applying these models can provide focus for future IgG engineering. For example, further development of mathematical models for multivalent binding may inform applications of antibody combinations of differing class for synergistic effector function. While we lack information about the effective avidity for TA99 engagement, more detailed characterization of its antibody binding might enable coordinate rational design of antibody class and antigen avidity. The versatility of antibody-based therapies ensure broad applicability of this approach to many diseases in which effector function plays a key role, including the design of therapeutic antibodies for the treatment of infectious disease, autoimmune disorders, and other cancers. 

More generally, these results demonstrate the ability of molecular models linked to data-driven inference to deconvolve *in vivo* function. Due to the baffling complexity of immune system, model-driven design is vital to the advancement of rationally designed immunotherapies. Like Fc receptors, many innate immune receptors are extensively characterized in their interactions and knockout effects, and yet operate through combinatorial complexity introduced by diverse sets of protein species. As binding profiles and signaling mechanisms of these receptors become better quantified, model-driven design will prove to be a powerful vehicle for further immune engineering advancement.
