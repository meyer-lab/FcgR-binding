# Discussion

A unified model for the coordinate contributions of IC avidity and affinity provides a framework for reasoning about the effects of changing antibody-antigen binding or constant region composition ([@Fig:Fit]). Glycosylation forms and engineered mutants, in addition to variation in antigen binding, exponentially expand the repertoire of antibody variants possible. The quantitative model presented here provides a robust framework for reasoning about the contributions each of these variables. Since it would not be feasible to experimentally explore all combinations of these variables, such a model is necessary for knowing which combinations would result in the most effective immunotherapeutic intervention. Further, a unified model for IC engagement may make it possible to consider the effects of antibody combinations in a rational manner.

In addition to enabling the intelligent design of immunotherapeutic interventions, a model of IC engagement makes it feasible to infer the factors contributing to the *in vivo* efficacy of existing immunotherapies ([@Fig:InVivoResults]). In particular, we show through through the application of our model to murine immunotherapy data that such a model can predict the effect of tumor-targeted antibodies better than affinity in isolation. This model additionally provides a number of specific, testable predictions: First, NK cell activation plays a significant and separable role in the response seen for many mIgG subclasses and nearly all of the partial response seen with mIgG2b ([@Fig:InVivoResults]H). Second, mIgG2a is distinct in its ability to activate DC-like populations, and that this property is essential for high efficacy.

Applying this model can provide focus for future IgG engineering. While we lack information about the effective avidity for TA99 engagement, more detailed characterization of its antibody binding might enable coordinate rational design of antibody class and antigen avidity. The versatility of antibody-based therapies ensure broad applicability of this approach to many diseases in which effector function plays a key role, including the design of therapeutic antibodies for the treatment of infectious disease, autoimmune disorders, and other cancers. 

More generally, these results demonstrate the ability of molecular models linked to data-driven inference to deconvolve *in vivo* function. Due to the baffling complexity of immune system, model-driven design is vital to the advancement of immunotherapeutic design. Like Fc receptors, many innate immune receptors are extensively characterized in their interactions and knockout effects, and yet operate through combinatorial complexity introduced by diverse sets of protein species. As binding profiles and signaling mechanisms of these receptors become better quantified, model-driven design will prove to be a powerful vehicle for further immune engineering advancement.
