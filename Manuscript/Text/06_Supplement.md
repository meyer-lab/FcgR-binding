## Binding Experiment

![**Predicted binding and multimerization within the *in vitro* immune complex-FcγR binding experiment.*** A) Predicted FcγR bound to IgG within each condition of the *in vitro* binding experiment. B) Predicted multimerized FcγR within each *in vitro* binding condition.](./Figures/FigureS1.svg){#fig:BindingDeconv}

![**Supplementary results to *in vivo* predictions and principal components analysis.*** A) Prediction performance upon crossvalidation for the model predicting *in vivo* efficacy with differing assumed IC concentration or avidity. B) Principal components analysis of predicted 1 nM IC binding and activation at with coordinate changes in murine IgG class and immune complex avidity. C) Corresponding principle components analysis for the human case. Points of the same color and shape in the human case display each of the eight possible genotypes between FcγRIIA-131H/R, FcγRIIB-232I/T and FcγRIIIA-158V/F.](./Figures/FigureS2.svg){#fig:SuppTwo}
