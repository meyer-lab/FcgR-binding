# Methods

All analysis was implemented in Python, and can be found at [https://github.com/meyer-lab/FcgR-binding](https://github.com/meyer-lab/FcgR-binding), release 1.0 (doi: [00.0000/arc0000000](https://doi.org/doi-url)).

## Immune complex binding measurement

IC binding to hFcγRs was analyzed using Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells stably expressing hFcγRs as previously described [@Lux:2013iv]. Receptor expression was quantified using antibodies against each hFcγR and flow cytometry measurement as previously described [@Lux:2013iv]. Briefly, ICs were generated by coincubation of 10 µg/ml anti-TNP hIgG and 5 µg/ml TNP-coupled BSA for 3 h with gentle shaking at room temperature. ICs were incubated with 100,000 CHO cells stably expressing hFcγRs for 1 h under gentle shaking at 4℃. Bound ICs were detected by flow cytometry using a PE-conjugated goat anti-human IgG F(ab')~2~ fragment at 0.5 mg/ml (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Each IC binding measurement was normalized to the average of all the points within that replicate. Receptor expression was quantified in terms of absolute number through comparison to fluorescence standards (QSC microspheres, Bangs Labs). Data were analyzed with Flow Cytometry Analysis Software (FlowJo) or FACSDiva Software.

## FcγR abundance measurement for primary cells

TODO: Needs to include how immune populations were purified and defined, sources for antibodies and spheres. Describe thresholding.

FcγR abundance was measured from peripheral blood leukocytes of C57Bl/6J mice under steady state conditions.

Surface receptor was quantitated by measuring antibody binding capacity (ABC). Calculation of ABC on cells is based on a reference curve for the correlation between fluorescence intensity (caused by the respective anti-FcγR antibody) and the number of antibody binding sites. This reference curve is generated using a group of micropheres with known ABC values, reflecting their ability to bind a known amount of antibody. In each experiment these microspheres are stained with the respective anti-FcγR antibody in the same concentration as it is used for staining of the cells.

From Markus:

FcγR abundance was measured by flow cytometry from peripheral blood leukocytes of female C57Bl/6J mice under steady state conditions. 

After erythrocyte lysis of anti-coagulated blood, cells were stained with antibodies to enable identification of cell types and for quantification of Fcγ receptors as listed in the Supplementary Information. Prior to addition of the staining antibodies cells were blocked with anti-FcγR antibodies to avoid unspecific binding to Fc receptors. Samples for quantification of FcγR4 were blocked with anti-FcγR2b/3 antibody clone 2.4G2. Samples for quantification of mFcγRI, mFcγRIIb or mFcγRIII were blocked with anti-FcγRIV antibody clone 9E9, since FcγRIV receptor has been shown to be a potential cause for unspecific binding of certain antibody isotypes in flow cytometry [here we could add a citation of one of our recent publications showing this, or just omit everything after “since..”]. TODO: Add citation.

A typical cell identification strategy was as follows: Cell aggregates were excluded by their forward light scatter (FSC) characteristics (area vs. height) and dead cells based on their capability for DAPI uptake. Leukocytes were identified by expression of common leukocyte marker CD45. Among those lymphocytes and myeloid cells were gated based on low side scatter (SSC) characteristics and absence of the Ly6G marker of neutrophilic granulocytes. NK cells were identified by low to intermediate CD11b expression together with expression of NK marker NK1.1. Among the highly CD11b-positive but NK1.1-negative cells, CD11b~high~ CD62L~high~ Gr-1~high~ classical and CD11b~high~ CD62L~low~ Gr-1~low~ non-classical monocytes were distinguished based on their differential expression of Gr-1 and in most experiments additionally also of CD62L. Among the granulocytes with high SSC and CD11b expression, eosinophils were identified by their very high SSC, low FSC and absence of Ly6G, whereas neutrophils were characterized by intermediately high side and forward scatter and presence of the neutrophil marker Ly6G.

Surface receptor was quantitated by measuring antibody binding capacity (ABC) for antibodies specific for the respective Fcγ receptor. Calculation of ABC on cells is based on a reference curve for the correlation between fluorescence intensity (caused by the respective anti-FcγR antibody) and the number of antibody binding sites using a group of beads with known ABC values, reflecting their ability to bind a known amount of antibody. These curves were established in each experiment for all tested anti-FcγR antibodies, using Quantum Simply Cellular (QSC) anti-mouse or anti-rat beads (Bangs Laboratories Ltd.)—depending on the host species of the respective anti-FcγR antibody—according to manufacturer’s instructions. Anti-FcγR4 antibody 9E9 is derived from Armenian hamster, but was found to be efficiently bound by the anti-mouse QSC beads. Yet, in most experiments these beads were pre-coated with mouse anti-hamster moieties prior to staining with 9E9.	

All anti-FcγR antibodies used for Fc quantification were used as conjugates with R-PE. They were either purchased pre-labelled or were conjugated in-house.

In each experiment QSC microspheres are stained with the respective anti-FcγR antibody in the same concentration as it was used for cell staining.	

To allow subtraction of ABC-background accounting for background fluorescence of the cells, FMO ("fluorescence-minus-one") controls were used in each experiment, where cells were stained with all antibodies for cell type identification but without anti-FcγR antibody.

Flow cytometric analysis was done on a FACS Canto II (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg) and data were analyzed with FACSDiva Software (BD). For ABC calculation we used the QuickCal software provided by Bangs Laboratories.

## *In vivo* regression

Regression against *in vivo* effectiveness of mIgG treatments was performed by least-squares (`scipy.optimize.least_squares`). Association constants for all combinations of mIgG and mFcγR were obtained from previous experimental measurements [@Gavin20; @Robinette:2015tp]. Each effectiveness was presented as the percent reduction in the number of lung metastases quantified [@Nimmerjahn:2005hu]. To account for the limited range of this quantity (e.g. one cannot have a reduction of 200%), the regression was transformed by tanh such that:

$$ y = tanh (X \cdot p) $$ {#eq:lsq}

so that $\lim_{x\to\infty} y(x) = 1$. $X$ is the predicted mFcγR activity for each cell line according to our model, and $p$ is the regression weights.

### PCA of mIgG-mFcγR affinities

Principle component analysis was performed using `scikit-learn` and the affinities of the four mIgGs (mIgG1, mIgG2a, mIgG2b, mIgG3), with or without knockout treatments, for each of four receptors (mFcγRI, mFcγRIIB, mFcγRIII, mFcγRIV). Association constants for all combinations of mIgG and mFcγR were obtained from previous experimental measurements [@Bruhns:2009kg]. The affinity for a knocked-out or blocked mFcγR was assumed to be zero. The affinities were not normalized before PCA transformation.
