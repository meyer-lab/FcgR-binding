# Methods

All analysis was implemented in Python, and can be found at [https://github.com/meyer-lab/FcgR-binding](https://github.com/meyer-lab/FcgR-binding), release 1.0 (doi: [00.0000/arc0000000](https://doi.org/doi-url)).

## Immune complex binding measurement

IC binding to hFcγRs was analyzed using Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells stably expressing hFcγRs as previously described [@Lux:2013iv]. Receptor expression was quantified using antibodies against each hFcγR and flow cytometry measurement as previously described [@Lux:2013iv]. Receptor expression was quantified in terms of absolute number through comparison to fluorescence standards (QSC microspheres, Bangs Labs). Briefly, ICs were generated by coincubation of 10 mg/ml anti-TNP hIgG and 5 mg/ml TNP-coupled BSA for 3 h with gentle shaking at room temperature. ICs were incubated with 100,000 CHO cells stably expressing hFcγRs for 1 h under gentle shaking at 4℃. Bound ICs were detected by flow cytometry using a PE-conjugated goat anti-human IgG F(ab')~2~ fragment at 0.5 mg/ml (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Data were analyzed with Flow Cytometry Analysis Software (FlowJo) or FACSDiva Software.

## *In vivo* regression

Regression against *in vivo* efficacy of hIgG treatments was performed by least-squares (`scipy.optimize.least_squares`). Each efficacy was presented as the percent reduction in the number of lung metastases quantified [@Nimmerjahn:2005hu]. To account for the limited range of this quantity (e.g. one cannot have a reduction of 200%), the regression was performed with a hyberbolic relationship, such that:

$$ y = F (X \cdot p) $$ {#eq:lsq}

where $F$ is the normal distribution cumulative density function, with mean and standard deviation varied during fitting.

### PCA of hIgG-hFcγR affinities

Principle component analysis was performed using `scikit-learn` and the affinities of the four mIgGs (mIgG1, mIgG2a, mIgG2b, mIgG3), with or without knockout treatments, for each of four receptors (mFcγRI, mFcγRIIB, mFcγRIII, mFcγRIV). The affinity for a knocked-out or blocked hFcγR was assumed to be zero. The affinities were not normalized before PCA transformation.
