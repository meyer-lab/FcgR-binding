\begin{abstract}
Many immune receptors transduce activation across the plasma membrane through their clustering. In the case of Fc\textgamma{} receptors, this clustering is usually driven by binding to antibodies of differing affinity in turn bound to multivalent antigen. As a consequence of this activation mechanism, accounting for and rationally manipulating IgG effector function is complicated by, among other factors, the contribution of differing affinities to multiple \fcgr{}s and changes in the valency of antigen binding. In this study, we show that a model of multivalent receptor-ligand binding can effectively account for the contribution of IgG-\fcgr{} affinity and immune complex valency. This model in turn enables us to make specific predictions about the effect of immune complexes of defined composition. In total, these results enable rationally designed IgG effector function, or deconvolution of function, in both a forward and reverse manner.
