\section{Introduction}


%- Antibodies are critical and central regulators of the immune response.
%	- Antibodies within the IgG isotype interact with FcgR receptors expressed widely among innate immune effector cells.


%- A more complete, quantitative understanding of IgG-FcgR function would aid understanding and modulation of cancer and autoimmune diseases.
%	- Previous studies have characterized the effects of IgG glycosylation (which serves to modulate FcgR affinity) and immune complex avidity on the binding of IgG-antigen complexes (Lux).
%	- In addition, studies have carefully quantified the individual FcgR-IgG affinities (Bruhns).
%	- Models of multivalent ligand binding to monovalent receptors have been successfully employed to study function of other immune receptors such as the B cell and T cell receptors (Stone, Perelson).
%		- However, the FcgR family presents the considerable additional challenge of multiple distinct receptor classes being expressed simultaneously within cells.
%		- Additionally, the multiple FcgRs present, with activating and inhibitory roles, ensure that any manipulation of immune complex composition will necessarily have multivariate effects.
